          <p>Hi, I'm Kilian, a 18-years-old computer science student with a passion for problem solving and a knack for developping new tech.
            I'm currently in my first year of college. My education will last two more years where i will focus on development.
          </p>
          <p>I've had the chance to be in a college that focus on project to give us some more real experience to prepare us. Those project focus
            on different language that we learn during the semester, if you want to know more about some of them you can check the experience section.
            </p>
          <p>When I'm not in college you can find me learning language or framework we don't learn about during those time, for exemple I'm currently looking
            at some way to improve my ability to use TailWind. I think learning a lot of language will help me uderstand better the way of work of some language.
            </p>
          <p>If you're interested in chatting about dev, or about giving me some advice on some language i should prioritize. Feel free to connect with me, I will
            always be hapy to learn and discuss about new tech. You can contact me in the section about it.
          </p>

                the database.

              <p>This one was one of my favourite, we were alone and we had to create a website from scratch. There was an obligatory theme, that of human health, 
                because of this project i find it more enjoyable to do some web devlopment than before.
